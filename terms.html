(“us”, “we”,								or “our”). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and								compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to								access								or use the Service.

You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing								Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of								subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. At the end of each Billing Cycle,								your								Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or								Recime cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account								management page or by contacting Recime customer support team. A valid payment method, including								credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall								provide								Recime with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip								code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment								information, you automatically authorize Recime to charge all Subscription fees incurred through								your account to any such payment instruments. Should automatic billing fail to occur for any								reason, Recime will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,								within a								certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on								the invoice.</p>						</div>					</div>					<div class="terms__column">						<div class="terms__subtitle">Fee Changes</div>						<div class="terms__text text">							<p>Recime Inc, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the								Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.

Recime will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of								any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before								such change becomes effective. Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee								change								comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>						</div>					</div>					<div class="terms__column">						<div class="terms__subtitle">Refunds</div>						<div class="terms__text text">							<p> Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>						</div>					</div>					<div class="terms__column">						<div class="terms__subtitle">Accounts</div>						<div class="terms__text text">							<p> When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the								age of 13, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all								times.								Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your								account on the Service.
